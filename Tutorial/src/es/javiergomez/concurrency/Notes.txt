Singleton. Example of volatile vars, synchronized block of code and double checking 

In order to instanciate the Singleton object (lazy loading) getInstance checks if it already exists
check should be done in a volatile var to ensure that it's updated inmediately after write by any thread
If not instantiated start a synchronixed block of code, check again the variable (to avoid race conditions) and create the object
